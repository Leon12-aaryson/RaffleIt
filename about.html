                    <h4>RaffleItApp exists to help organizations easily <br> raise funds & for everyone to have fun along
                        the way.</h4>
                    <p>Born from the belief that we can all Do Good & Have Fun, RaffleItApp has set out to revolutionize
                        fundraising by providing a 50/50 raffle platform for the 21st century; less work for charities,
                        more fun for donors.</p>
                    <p>By leveraging technology and social sharing, we're creating a new category of incentivized,
                        gamified charitable giving that allows charities to easily host events that donors actively
                        engage with, in hopes of potentially winning themselves.</p>
                    <p>Our online platform seamlessly connects organizations, clubs, charities and more with virtually a
                        limitless audience made available through the power of mobile connectivity. This combined with
                        an intuitive interface creates an engaging raffling experience both on and off-site, providing
                        both charities and donors an exciting way to make a difference.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, while our platform allows for fundraising across state lines (where accepted) and
                        in turn enhances the raffling experience and audience reach for charities, we are continually
                        looking to further expand states' acceptance of this engaging and successful means of
                        fundraising. As the world embraces technological advancements, we're curious why charities are
                        held to such antiquated rules which prevent them from leveraging technology and ultimately
                        raising more funds to make the world a better place.</p>
                    <p>It's our hope that as the world finds its new footing, charitable giving will be in stride with
                        these advancements and it's why we've built our platform not only for today, but also for
                        tomorrow. By providing an efficient and scalable solution for charities to easily host raffles
                        and access new donors, we're excited to take part in re-writing how people fundraise while
                        having fun in the process.</p>
